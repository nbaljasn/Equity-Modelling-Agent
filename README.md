>The Equity Modelling Agent is a data platform designed to streamline and enhance the process of stock selection. I aggregate diverse data sources like company fundamentals, macroeconomic indicators, and opinion data to create a comprehensive view of current and potential equity performance. The platform automatically produces standardized Excel reports, simplifying the analyst's workflow. Reports will contain valuation insights, economic context, and sentiment analysis delivered in a structured, easy-to-use format for enhanced decision-making. 

I attempt to make the Equity Modelling Agent into a powerful, yet efficient tool to generate insightful equity research without the need for extensive manual data collection and processing.
